Task 2:
Solve the following problem in C#. An arbitrary string is given, it is necessary to find the sum of all numbers in this string (namely, numbers, not numbers).
It is preferable to use regular expressions. Example:
 input >> "gf5k 35yt hf 2 fd12k "
 output >> 54

Task 3:
Given an array of strings filled with integers and simple operators + - * / , evaluate the data as an expression using Polish notation. For example, ["3", "+", "8", "*", "5"] should result in 43.
(In short: execute expression in Polish notation)
